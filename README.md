# Driving Drone Camera
Hey all,

This is website belongs to a school project, made by me and my group. On this page you will find all the files that belong to the site. It's nothing special, because I can't really code. Still, it was really fun to make this site. 

Driving Drone Camera, DDC, is a small car, powered by a Raspberry Pi 3B+. As the name says, this 'drone' has a built-in camera.
